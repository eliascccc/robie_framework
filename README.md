# Robot Runtime

A small Python runtime for email- and query-driven RPA

---

## Overview

Robot Runtime is a local Python runtime for small-scale RPA deployments.
The term “runtime” refers to everything except the UI automation itself:
job intake, orchestration, decision logic, logging, and result verification.
UI automation is delegated to an external RPA tool such as UiPath or Power Automate.
Together, the runtime and the RPA tool form the robot.

This project is designed as a simple way to get started with RPA in a business unit. It runs on a single machine as a single Python file.
The principle is: **screenclicks → handled by the RPA tool. The rest (logic and orchestration) → this python project**


Unlike traditional RPA setups — where a user selects and runs a predefined automation —
this runtime is event-driven. It continuously listens for incoming work (such as emails or data conditions),
interprets what it means, decides what action to take, and then executes via an RPA tool.

## Job source examples

The runtime supports two types of job sources: emails and queries.

#### Email-driven
A user sends an email → Python validates and prepares the job → writes to `handover.json` → RPA executes UI actions → Python verifies and responds.

#### Query-driven
Python polls a data source → detects a valid case → prepares a payload → signals RPA → RPA executes → Python verifies the outcome.

---

## Key idea

This project separates responsibilities between the runtime and the RPA tool:

* The **runtime (this project)** handles:
  - job intake (email / queries)
  - access control and validation
  - decision logic
  - preparing payloads and handover
  - verification and failure handling

* The **RPA tool** handles:
  - UI automation (clicks, keyboard input, ERP interaction)

They communicate through a file-based IPC mechanism (`handover.json`).

The diagram shows:

* How the Runtime and the RPA tool run independently
* How your RPA tool must be implemented

---

## Features

* Email-driven job processing (personal inbox)
* Shared inbox support (partially implemented)
* Query-driven jobs (ERP/data polling)
* SQLite audit-style logging (`job_audit.db`)
* Crash-safe mode (`safestop`)
* Built-in screen recording (ffmpeg)
* Final user replies after verification (DONE / FAIL)
* Screen-recording link included in final reply
* Runs without administrator rights
* Single-file runtime (`main.py`) for easy sharing and inspection
* Windows or Linux, with environment-specific setup

---



## Running the Project

### Requirements

* Python 3.14
* `openpyxl`
* `ffmpeg` (optional, for screen recording)

---

### Start

```bash
python main.py
```

---

### Test setup

Use included dev tools:

* `fake_jobs_generator.py`
* `rpa_tool_simulator.py`

---



## Intended Use Case

* Small internal automation (5–10 users)
* No dedicated RPA infrastructure
* No admin rights required
* Cheap “extra laptop” deployment
* Pilot / proof-of-concept automation

## Why not just use X?

#### Why not just use RPA for everything?

You can — but it tends to lead to:

* Business logic spread across visual workflows
* Difficult testing and debugging
* Fragile automations that break on small UI changes

In this project the RPA tool is used for what it does best: UI interactions (clicks, keyboard input, screen automation).
These tools include Microsoft Power Automate, UiPath Studio, Blue Prism, [Robot Framework](https://github.com/robotframework/robotframework), [TagUI](https://github.com/aisingapore/TagUI), [RPA for Python](https://github.com/tebelorg/RPA-Python)

---

#### Why not just use Python for everything?

Python is great for logic and data processing, but:

* It cannot reliably interact with arbitrary GUIs
* Many business systems (ERP, legacy apps) require UI automation

This project capitalize on the simplicity and large resources available for Python ecosystem.

---

#### Why not use an enterprise orchestrator?

Enterprise orchestrators (e.g. UiPath Orchestrator, Control Room, [orchestrator_rpa](https://github.com/daferferso/orchestrator_rpa), [openorchestrator](https://github.com/itk-dev-rpa/OpenOrchestrator)

* Require infrastructure, setup, and licensing
* Are designed for large-scale, multi-bot environments

This project intentionally avoids that scope and runs on a single machine with simple file- and DB-based state.
If you need distributed execution, queues, or centralized control — this project is the wrong tool.

## Deployment requirements

- a dedicated machine or “extra laptop”
- a mailbox such as rpa@yourcompany.com
- an external RPA tool
- environment-specific setup for mail backend, ERP/query backend, job handlers, recording path, operating hours, and network health check

## License

MIT (recommended)

## Status

Early-stage / experimental, but functional.
